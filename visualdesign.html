	<br>This picture is meaningful to me because i cutted paper from many magazine and book covers and gather lot of different paper cut and magazine paper cut and add all of them up together to color the elephant to give it a unique color.

	<br> 
	<br>This picture shown above was really important for me this is because we learned how to make creative drawings. Such as in the first picture it looks like a normal fish while in the second picture is transtion to completely different fish. Which gives surprising effects</br>

<img src="Artifactas/GirlDrawing.png" width="420" height="240" alt=""/>
	<br> i draw this girl inspired by the picture which is why this drawing is important for me because i tried my best to draw
	the same exact dress on the girl i have drawn whcih was kind of challangining. But i tried my best and drawed the dress exactly like the first picture. Which is why i am proud of this picture.
