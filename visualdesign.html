	<img src="Elephant.png" width="420" height="400" alt=""/>
	<br>
	This picture is meaningful to me because I cut out paper from variety magazines and book covers added all of them up together to color the elephant to give it a unique color.</br>

<img src="ImposterDrawing.png" width="420" height="370" alt=""/>
	<br> This drawing was drawn by me. Which is why it is important for me because that was also the first time i 
	ever drawn any imposter.

<img src="Artifactas/Art crafts.png" width="420" height="270" alt=""/>
	<br>This picture shown above was really important for me this is because we learned how to make creative drawings. Such as in the first picture it looks like a normal fish while in the second picture is transtion to completely different fish. Which gives surprising effects</br>

<img src="Artifactas/GirlDrawing.png" width="420" height="240" alt=""/>
	<br> For this assignment I drew a girl's costume that was inspired by a picture i found in google. This drawing is important to me because I tried my best to replicate the exact same dress on the girl I drew, which was quite challenging. However, I put in my best effort and was able to draw the dress exactly like the one in the picture. That's why I'm proud of this drawing.</br>

<img src="Surrealist Collage Project.png" width="420" height="200" alt=""/>
	<br>The project was significant to me because I took a picture of an animal's habitat and then added the picture of the animal to it. This was done to create a more realistic effect in the image.
	<br>

<img src="Themed Image Collage.png" width="420" height="500" alt=""/>
	<br>This image was created as part of an assignment where we were tasked with creating a theme by adding different images. Therefore, I added multiple images of different kinds of animals to show how they connect to nature and there importance.
