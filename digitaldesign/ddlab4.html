<div>
Everyday is like a blank canvas
You know you can paint it
</div>


<div>
<p>Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art
</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>
Ooh, every night's like looking at a dark screen
You're never too young or too old to dream
</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>
Trying to simplify into philosophy
Turn a star into a galaxy
</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>
Life is a work of art
Life is a work of
Life is a work of art
